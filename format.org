format

an important part of golem is the ability for one golem plugin to
communicate with another golem plugin.

this ipso facto demands a communication format.

two kinds of communication are discernable: streaming and bulk.

Key pieces of information for a record packet are:

- generating program
- data
- datatype
- data /streamclass/

it's important to distinguish between classes of data: a data can be
normal output, error output, exceptional output, or various numbers of
the same. golem uses the /streamclass/ to describe this
difference. Initial streamclasses are:

- stdout
- stderr

Others are likely to arise based on application-specific needs.
