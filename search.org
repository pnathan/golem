search

many uses of computers involve /search/. Search on modern desktops
involves two questions: what is the file named, and what is the file
containing.

golem will perform text-based search for both:

golem find name /filename/

golem find content /content/

(the content of a directory are the files in the directory)

golem will boost to the usual second level: hand-crafted metadata

golem will allow tagging and searching by tag:

golem tag /filename/ tagstring

golem find tag /tagstring/

On a more exotic capability set:

golem will allow /assocations/ between files and searching the
associations. A file can be defined to be /associated/ with other
files.

golem will allow textual similarity searches between file content. A
similarity search on a file will return a % similarity between its
content and other files.
